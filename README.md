Project Overview:
Cyber Sentinel is a behavior-based intrusion detection system for IoT networks.
It uses a Random Forest classifier to detect attacks and employs SHAP for explainable AI.
If an attack is detected, it sends a PDF report and a confusion matrix image to a configured email address.

Files Included:
1. Cyber_Sentinel_IoT_Attack_Detection_Final.docx – Research paper with full details and results.
2. mailpdf.py – Python script to load data, train the model, detect anomalies, generate reports, and send email alerts.
3. Screenshot (156).png to Screenshot (181).png – Visual result images used in the paper.

How to Run:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn
   - fpdf

2. Update your Gmail credentials in `mailpdf.py` for email functionality.
3. Update the dataset file path in the `file_path` variable within the `mailpdf.py`.
4. Run the script using the following command:

   python mailpdf.py

5. If attacks are detected, you’ll receive an email with attached reports.

Note:
For Gmail SMTP to work, enable "Less secure app access" or use an app-specific password from your Google account.
